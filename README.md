This work is my course project in the 2nd year of university studies.
# Sea Battle Game
Sea Battle is a classic two-player game where each player strategically places their ships on a grid and takes turns 
guessing the coordinates to attack the opponent's ships. The objective is to sink all of the opponent's ships before they sink yours.
# Features
- Auto configuration: The game allows players to automatically set up their ships on the grid.
- Manual configuration: Players can manually place their ships on the grid, providing more control over the setup.
- Battle mode: Players take turns attacking each other's ships by guessing coordinates on the opponent's grid.
- Statistics: The game keeps track of the player's wins, losses, consecutive wins, and record.
- Sea Monster: An additional challenge in the game where a sea monster attacks randomly, adding suspense and unpredictability to the gameplay.
